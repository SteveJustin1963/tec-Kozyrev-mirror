Summary
This text discusses various topics, including a 1990 experiment on enhancing human perception, the concept of 
time as a non-linear dimension, and the controversial theories of Russian physicist Nikolai Kazarev regarding 
torsion and the existence of The Ether.

Facts
üî¨ In 1990, Russian scientists conducted an experiment to enhance human super perception or ESP using a 
device made of rolled aluminum.
üåå The experiment resulted in strange phenomena, such as disc-shaped lights, balls of energy, and intensified 
Northern Lights around the lab.
‚è∞ The device not only boosted psychic abilities but also enabled subjects to view any place and time in the world.
üë¶ A participant in the experiment experienced a vision of himself as a child, observing his own past.
üåë In the early 20th century, Russian physicist Nikolai Kazarev made controversial discoveries, including 
volcanic activity on the moon and theories on torsion.
üå™Ô∏è Torsion refers to the twisting of space-time and is considered by Kazarev as a cornerstone of his work.
üåÄ The Einstein cartoon theory proposes that space-time can be twisted, not just curved, due to the spinning of 
subatomic particles.
üåå Kazarev's theory suggests the existence of The Ether, an invisible dynamic medium that fills the universe.
‚è≥ According to Kazarev, time possesses energy and structure, actively participating in the universe's existence.
‚è∞ Time energy can have different densities, speeds, and even move in reverse, influencing matter, space, 
and physical phenomena.
üåç Time energy impacts various aspects of life, including weather, plant growth, DNA, and the behavior of stars.
üß™ Kazarev's theories are still debated today, and his work challenges mainstream scientific beliefs.

Bending Time: The Successful Time Travel Experiments using Kozyrev Mirrors. In December 1990, in a remote village 
above the Arctic Circle, two Russian scientists embarked on a daring experiment. Their goal was to enhance human
‚Äúsuper-perception‚Äù or ESP. They built a device that could shield subjects from electromagnetic interference 
and amplify their biological energy. The device was a large tube of rolled aluminum with a chair inside. 
As soon as the device was built, strange phenomena occurred around the village. Disc-shaped lights hovered 
around the lab. Balls of energy appeared and disappeared. The Northern Lights became so bright and vivid that 
they seemed to take physical shape. Inside the lab, anyone who approached the device felt an unexplainable 
sense of dread. It took a while to persuade anyone to try it. When the first subject finally sat in the chair, 
a flash of energy erupted that stunned everyone in the lab. The device worked. But it maybe worked a little too well.
Not only did it boost people‚Äôs psychic abilities, it also enabled them to view any place in the world. 
And soon, they could view any place in time. In fact, these experiments confirmed a theory first proposed 
in the 1950s. That time, as we know it, doesn‚Äôt exist.
